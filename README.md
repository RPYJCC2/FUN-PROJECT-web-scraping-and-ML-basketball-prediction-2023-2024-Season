The Gist:
1. This project was for fun
2. I scraped basketball team stats from basketballreference.com; it took about 4-5 hours because that's how long it takes without getting rate limited
3. I created a simple machine learning prediction model for classification of wins and losses and performed cross validation
4. In preparation of the 2023-2024 GSW vs. LAL playoff series, I show an example of using trained weights to predict game outcomes using only team ID.
