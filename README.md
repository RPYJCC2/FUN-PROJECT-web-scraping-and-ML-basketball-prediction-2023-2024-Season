The Gist:
1. I scraped basketball team stats from basketballreference.com; it took about 4-5 hours to scrape one years worth of data (without getting rate limited).
2. I created a simple machine learning prediction model for classification of wins and losses and performed cross validation.
3. I also explored randomforests to predict the over/under using a rolling average.
